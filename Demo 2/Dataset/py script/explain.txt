The data in "ks - projecs 2016" have errors:
there are commas in the project name and that making a shift in columns 

so has to write a python script to remove those commas to separate columns coreect by comma 

first wrote remove_q function to remove many qoutes and make it one single qoute 

second wrote remove_comma function to remove all commas between project name

CSV Data Cleanup Script
Overview
This Python script cleans up malformed CSV data where:

Unnecessary quotes (") cause parsing issues.

Commas inside project names incorrectly split columns.

The script processes a CSV file (test.csv) and outputs a cleaned version (test_3.csv).

Problem Description
The original dataset (ks-projecs 2016) contains errors:

Excessive quotes: Multiple quotes (") disrupt CSV parsing.

Commas in project names: These cause columns to shift when read by CSV tools.

Solution
Script Workflow
remove_q(text)

Converts text to a list for mutability.

Replaces every 4th consecutive quote with a space to reduce clutter.

Returns a string with simplified quotes.

remove_comm(text)

Processes each line of text.

Removes commas between quotes (e.g., "Project, Name" → "Project Name").

Uses a flag counter to identify quoted sections.

File Handling

Reads test.csv → cleans quotes → saves as test_2.csv.

Reads test_2.csv → cleans commas → saves as test_3.csv.
